<h1>Philosophy <small>Why Transdown Syntax looks like it does</small></h1>

<p>My two main inspirations for Transdown were John Gruber&#8217;s <a href="http://daringfireball.net/markdown">Markdown</a> and John August&#8217;s <a href="http://fountain.io">Fountain</a>. The inspirational lineage is so strong that I chose the name <strong>Transdown</strong> to reflect that heritage. And, much of the syntax descends from their ideas about what these languages are and how they should work.</p>

<p>The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. <footer>John Gruber in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"><cite title="Introduction to Markdown">Introduction to Markdown</cite></a></footer></p>

<blockquote><p>Fountain is not an app. It’s not even really a file format. It’s a simple set of straightforward <a href="http://fountain.io/syntax">rules</a> for writing a screenplay in plain text….Fountain is designed to “just work” if you simply typed some text that looked like a screenplay.</p><footer>John August in <a href="http://fountain.io/faq"><cite title="Fountain FAQ">Fountain FAQ</cite></a></footer></blockquote>

<h1>Transdown&#8217;s Block Structure</h1>

<p>Transdown assumes your transcript will be built of blocks, which are just lines of source text separated by one or more blank lines.</p>
<pre><code class="(null)">These two lines

Are separated by a blank line</code></pre>
<pre><code class="(null)">These two lines
have no blank line in between :-(</code></pre>

<h1>Episodes</h1>

<p>Transcripts are organized around episodes. You can denote the title of an episode using <a href="http://spec.commonmark.org/0.17/#atx-headers">ATX-style header syntax</a>, which just means beginning a line </p>
