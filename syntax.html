      <p class="lead">Transdown assumes your transcript will be built of blocks, which are just lines of source text separated by one or more blank lines.</p>

      <p>Episode titles, turns, and reference lists are all block-level elements. To write in transdown, you should separate those elements (<em>especially turns</em>) from one other with one or more blank lines</p>
      <pre>These four lines

Are each separated by a blank line

So each line is a block

And there are four blocks</pre>
      <pre>These four lines
have no blank line in between

<h1 class="page-header">Conversational Turns</h1>

<p>Conversational Turns are the meat and potatoes of most transcripts. And, when it comes to recognizing what you type, Transdown tries to be really both smart and flexible. The result is that whether you're transcribing with timestamps down to the frame-number, or you're just content-logging and you don't care who's speaking, Transdown just <em>gets it right</em>.</p>

<h1 class="page-header">Philosophy <small>Why Transdown Syntax looks like it does</small></h1>

<p>
 My two main inspirations for Transdown were John Gruber&#8217;s <a href="http://daringfireball.net/markdown">Markdown</a> and John August&#8217;s <a href="http://fountain.io">Fountain</a>. The inspirational lineage is so strong that I chose the name <strong>Transdown</strong> to reflect that heritage. And, much of the syntax descends from their ideas about what these languages are and how they should work.

   The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

   Fountain is not an app. It’s not even really a file format. It’s a simple set of straightforward <a href="http://fountain.io/syntax">rules</a> for writing a screenplay in plain text….Fountain is designed to “just work” if you simply typed some text that looked like a screenplay.
